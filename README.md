🧠 ML Models with Interactive GUIs

This repository contains multiple Machine Learning model implementations along with fully functional GUI interfaces created using Streamlit and Tkinter. Each project walks through the complete workflow — from data preprocessing and model building to saving the trained model and deploying it in a user-friendly graphical interface.
